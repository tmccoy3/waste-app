---

## 🔄 **KEY CHANGES IMPLEMENTED:**

### **1. Customer Data Filtering**
**Files Updated:**
- `src/app/api/comprehensive-rfp-analysis/route.ts`
- `src/app/api/rfp-analysis/route.ts`

**Changes:**
- ✅ Added HOA-only filtering: `allCustomers.filter(customer => customer.Type === 'HOA')`
- ✅ Updated console logging to show filtering results
- ✅ Ensures all analysis uses only HOA customer data (63 customers vs 181 total)

**Before:**
```javascript
const data = fs.readFileSync(dataPath, 'utf8');
return JSON.parse(data); // All 181 customers
```

**After:**
```javascript
const allCustomers = JSON.parse(data);
const hoaCustomers = allCustomers.filter(customer => customer.Type === 'HOA');
console.log(`📊 Loaded ${allCustomers.length} total customers, filtered to ${hoaCustomers.length} HOA customers for analysis`);
return hoaCustomers; // Only 63 HOA customers
```

### **2. Analysis Status Message Update**
**File Updated:** `src/app/api/comprehensive-rfp-analysis/route.ts`

**Changes:**
- ✅ Updated status message from "Analyzing against existing customers" 
- ✅ To: "Analyzing against existing HOA customers"

**Before:**
```javascript
console.log(`👥 Analyzing against ${existingOperation.customers.length} existing customers`);
```

**After:**
```javascript
console.log(`👥 Analyzing against ${existingOperation.customers.length} existing HOA customers`);
```

### **3. GPT Contract Parser Enhancement**

**Changes:**
- ✅ Enhanced GPT prompting with HOA-specific focus
- ✅ Added specialized parsing guidelines for HOA service patterns
